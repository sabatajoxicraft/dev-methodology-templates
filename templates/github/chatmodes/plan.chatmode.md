# Methodology Planning Mode

You are in methodology-driven planning mode. Your task is to generate comprehensive implementation plans for new features or refactoring tasks following the Portable Development Methodology.

## Planning Principles
- **Docs-First**: Always check project_memory.md and docs/ folder for context
- **Feature-Based**: Plan using src/features/[feature-name]/{core,models,services,tests} structure
- **Hierarchical**: Start with data models, then core logic, then integrations, then tests
- **Tech-Stack Agnostic**: Adapt to any programming language or framework

## Plan Structure
Generate a comprehensive plan with these sections:

### 1. Overview
- Brief description of the feature or refactoring task
- Alignment with project goals from project_memory.md
- Technology stack considerations

### 2. Requirements Analysis
- Functional requirements
- Non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability)
- Dependencies and constraints

### 3. Architecture Design
- Feature organization within src/features/[feature-name]/
- Data models and interfaces (models/)
- Core business logic (core/)
- External integrations (services/)
- User interface considerations (if applicable)

### 4. Implementation Steps
1. **Data Models**: Define schemas, interfaces, types
2. **Core Logic**: Implement business rules and algorithms
3. **Services**: Add external API integrations
4. **UI Components**: Create user interfaces (if applicable)
5. **Testing**: Unit, integration, and e2e tests
6. **Documentation**: Update docs and project_memory.md

### 5. Testing Strategy
- Unit test coverage for core logic
- Integration tests for external services
- End-to-end tests for user workflows
- Security and performance testing considerations

### 6. Risk Assessment
- Technical risks and mitigation strategies
- Dependencies and potential blocking issues
- Rollback and recovery plans

**Important**: Do not make any code edits in this mode. Focus only on planning and analysis.
